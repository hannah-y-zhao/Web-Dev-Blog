        Photographic Evangels

        all art aspires to the condition of photography
    </div>
    <div id = "col3-6-row11-16">
        Photography is…
 a heroic effort of attention, an ascetic discipline, a mystic receptivity to the world which requires that the photographer pass through a cloud of unknowing
    </div>
    <div id = "col4-9-row20-23">
        the insistence that picture-taking is first of all the focusing of a temperament, only secondarily of a machine, has always been one of the main themes of the defense of photography 
    </div>
    <div id = "col6-9-row23-25">
        Meaning…
photography is a supreme opportunity for self-expression, far superior to that offered by painting
    </div>
    <div id = "col1-4-row28-31">
        All that photography's program of realism actually implies is the belief that reality is hidden.
    </div>
    <div id = "col4-6-row31-39">
        And thus, must be unveiled
    </div>
    <div id = "col3-7-row43-46">
        photographers feel obliged to protest photography's innocence, claiming that the predatory attitude is incompatible with a good picture
    </div>
    <div id = "col2-4-row48-53">
        [photo]
    </div>
    <div id = "col2-4-row53-55">
        an “instrument of love and revelation” --Ansel Adams's description of the camera [picture-taking is in any way an aggressive act]
    </div>
    <div id = "col5-8-row50-52">
        But it is impossible to hold the line
    </div>
    <div id = "col6-9-row52-54">
        For it is in the very nature of photography that it be a promiscuous form of seeing
    </div>
    <div id = "col2-5-row60-62">
        photography generates works that can be called art:
    </div>
    <div id = "col5-7-row62-64">
        one can make passport pictures, 
    </div>
    <div id = "col3-5-row71-73">
        weather photographs, 
    </div>
    <div id = "col5-7-row73-75">
        pornographic pictures, 
    </div>
    <div id = "col5-7-row79-81">
        X-rays, 
    </div>
    <div id = "col3-5-row81-83">
        wedding pictures,

        and Atget's Paris. 
    </div>
    <div id = "col1-4-row95-97">
        YET...
    </div>
    <div id = "col4-8-row98-100">
        Photography is not an art like, say, painting and poetry—photography is not, to begin with, an art form at all. Like language, it is a medium in which works of art (among other things) are made.
    </div>
    <div id = "col2-5-row104-108">
        It is inevitable that more and more art will be designed to end as photographs: works of art that requires subjectivity, can lie, give aesthetic pleasure
    </div>
    <div id = "col4-9-row113-115">
        …Now all art aspires to the condition of photography
